## ECG signal conditioning by Morphological filters
Clinically collected electrocardiographic (ECG) signals are often contaminated with a lot of noise and to obtain information from the noisy signals is always challenging. In order to facilitate automated ECG alanysis, Signal Conditioning is a necessity. In this project I implemented a morphological filter technique for the baseline correction and noise suppression with minimum signal distortion.
Data set is gathered from physionet.org
In order to keep eye on erros, we generated a synthesised ECG signal with specific known characteristics and then by knowing the result and mean square error on that better produce reults for real data sets.
